# Node.js OAuth 2.0 Quickstart

A quickstart app for integrators looking to use HubSpot's OAuth 2.0. Written in Node.js.

_**Note:** This app does not store any data in a persistent way, so restarting the app will clear the retrieved access tokens._

   
## Prerequisites

Before running the quickstart app, make sure you have:

1. The tools required to run using the method of your choice:
   - Option 1: Running locally using Node.js: [Node.js (>=6)](https://nodejs.org) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

_**Note:** You must be a super-admin for the account that you want to install the app in._

## Running locally using Node.js

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   $ git clone git@github.com:HubSpot/oauth-quickstart-nodejs.git
   ```
2. Create a **`.env`** file in the root of the repository with the ID and secret for your app (found on the app settings page), eg:
   ```
   CLIENT_ID='xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'
   CLIENT_SECRET='yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy'
   SCOPE='crm.objects.contacts.read,forms'
   ```
   The `SCOPE` environment variable is optional in this example. 
   If not set, this application will use the scope `crm.objects.contacts.read`.
   The scopes can be separated by a comma, space, or URL-encoded space (`%20`)
3. From the root of the repository, run:
   ```bash
   $ yarn install
   $ yarn start
   ```
4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000/install` to kick off the OAuth 2.0 flow
